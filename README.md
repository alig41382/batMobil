🦇 Batman 2D - Gotham Vigilance TrainingThis project is a foundational 2D educational game built in Unity, designed to implement and demonstrate core game development mechanics. The theme is a simplified version of the Batman universe, focusing on essential player controls, state management, and inter-system communication (e.g., player state triggering global effects).It serves as an excellent starting point for understanding Finite State Machines (FSM), responsive controls, and visual/audio feedback loops in a 2D environment.🚀 Getting StartedThese instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.PrerequisitesUnity: Recommended version 2021+Clone or download the project repository.How to Run the GameOpen the project folder in the Unity Editor.Navigate to the main scene (e.g., Assets/Scenes/MainScene.unity).Press the ▶ (Play) button in the Unity Editor to start the game.🎮 Controls and GameplayBatman can move around the city and switch between distinct operational modes, each triggering different environmental effects.Movement ControlsKeyActionDescriptionA / ←Move LeftFaces and moves the character left.D / →Move RightFaces and moves the character right.W / ↑ForwardMoves forward in the direction the character is currently facing.S / ↓BackwardMoves backward (retreats) from the direction the character is facing.Movement is directional and handled by flipping the character's horizontal localScale.x property.Player State SwitchingBatman operates in three distinct modes, managed by the PlayerState system:KeyStateDescriptionIntegrated Systems TriggeredDefaultNormalThe default, balanced state.N/ACStealthBatman enters silent, low-profile mode.N/ASpaceAlertHigh-profile mode that signals authorities.Alert Lights System, Bat-Signal AlertSystem TogglesKeySystemActionBBat-SignalToggles the Bat-Signal light and sprite on or off.🚨 Core Gameplay Systems1. Alert Lights System (AlertLights.cs)This system provides a visual and auditory response to the Alert state.Visuals: Alternating red and blue lights flash.Audio: A police-style siren sound loops while active.Activation: The system is fully tied to the player's Alert mode. It activates instantly when the player switches to Alert and deactivates when the player leaves Alert mode.Customization: The flash speed is an Inspector-friendly serialized field for easy tuning.2. Bat-Signal Controller (BatSignalController.cs)The iconic symbol of Gotham's distress.Toggleable: Can be turned on and off using the B key.Visuals: Displays a stylized yellow signal sprite and an attached light effect.System Communication: When activated, it sends an alert event to the PlayerState system, reinforcing the high-alert status.🛠 Project Implementation SummaryThis project successfully establishes a solid foundation for a larger 2D game by demonstrating essential mechanics: effective state machines, player input handling, animation flipping, and synchronous communication between disparate game systems. It is ready for expansion with combat, missions, and more detailed Gotham environments.📁 Folder StructureThe project follows a standard, organized folder structure:Assets/
